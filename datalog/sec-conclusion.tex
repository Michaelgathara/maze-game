\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%Datalog is an increasingly-popular implementation language for static
%analyses and other formal systems due to its balance of expressivity
%and performance.
In this work we extended Datalog with subfacts,
explicating a core language, \core{}, which supports subfacts as
first-class facts, values, and threads. This straightforward semantic extension enables
several key innovations, including the expression of higher-order
functions via defunctionalization, subfact indexing,
and a rich connection to constructive logic via the proofs-as-programs
interpretation. We have implemented these ideas in \slog{}, a fully featured language
for data-parallel structured deduction, using a new MPI-based relational algebra backend,
and we demonstrate its application to operational semantics, abstract interpreters, and
formal systems broadly. Our experiments show that \slog{} is competitive with,
or (when programming with structured heap data) orders-of-magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art systems, showing improved data-parallelism and scaling
up to hundreds of cores on large unified machines and high-performance clusters.
